            I&apos;m a frontend developer focused majorly on the frontend side
            of the web, with experience in React, Nextjs and JavaScript. <br />I
            enjoy building accessible User interfaces. When I am not writing
            codes that will display awesome interfaces or codes that will solve
            problems, you&apos;ll find me surfing the internet, reading codes on
            github, playing my violin, swimming and spending time with friends
            and family.
